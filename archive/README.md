Documents are archived when:

1. **Issue resolved** - The problem described no longer exists
2. **Feature complete** - Implementation finished and documented elsewhere
3. **Technology deprecated** - Replaced by new stack (e.g., Prisma → Convex)
4. **Duplicate removed** - Consolidated into canonical documentation
5. **Historical value** - Worth keeping for reference but not actively maintained

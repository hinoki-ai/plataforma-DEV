## 🔍 Using Archived Documents

These documents are useful for:

1. **Historical context** - Understanding past issues and solutions
2. **Learning** - Reviewing troubleshooting approaches
3. **Reference** - Comparing old vs current implementations

## 🗑️ Archival Policy

Documents are archived when:

1. **Issue resolved** - The problem described no longer exists
2. **Feature complete** - Implementation finished and documented elsewhere
3. **Technology deprecated** - Replaced by new stack (e.g., Prisma → Convex)
4. **Duplicate removed** - Consolidated into canonical documentation
5. **Historical value** - Worth keeping for reference but not actively maintained
